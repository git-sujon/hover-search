Google Custom Search API Setup

To show results inside the tab, you need a Google Custom Search API key and a Search Engine ID:

1. Go to https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview and follow the steps to get an API key.
2. Create a Custom Search Engine (CSE) at https://cse.google.com/cse/all and get your Search Engine ID (CX).
3. In `content.js`, replace the empty `API_KEY` and `CX` values with your credentials.

- Click the search icon to open a modal panel with Google search results including thumbnails, ratings, and rich metadata when available.
- Switch between modal and sidebar view using the toggle button.
